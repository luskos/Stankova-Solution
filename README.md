Title: A Vacuum-Admissible Analytic Surface Mimicking Gravitational Behavior via Adapted Yin-Yang Geometry

Summary:
This document presents an original analytic surface inspired by the Yin-Yang symbol, shown to locally satisfy the vacuum Einstein field equations in 2D analog. The surface curvature, geodesic trajectories, and Christoffel symbols were derived and validated numerically and symbollically. Einstein Tensor were calculated both numerically and symbolically. The model offers both physical insight and experimental potential in analog gravity.

1. Geometry Definition

The surface is defined in 3D space via:

Z(x, y) = A * x * y / (1 + x^2 + y^2)

Where:

x, y: Cartesian coordinates on the plane

Z(x, y): height field

A: amplitude constant controlling curvature intensity

This formula ensures:

Smoothness and differentiability

Symmetry and central inversion behavior

Curvature that decays with distance from origin

2. Curvature Analysis

Using the induced metric from the embedding, the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar were computed.

Results:

Scalar curvature R(x, y) was found to be exactly zero along certain radial directions.

In other areas, curvature is small but nonzero, indicating local spacetime warping.

No singularities or divergences were observed.

Conclusion:

The surface is compatible with vacuum Einstein equations in specific regions (R = 0), making it a valid testbed.

3. Christoffel Symbols and Geodesics

From the metric, Christoffel symbols were derived analytically.

Geodesic equations:

d^2x/dt^2 + Gamma^x_ij dx^i dx^j = 0d^2y/dt^2 + Gamma^y_ij dx^i dx^j = 0

Numerical simulations of geodesics show:

Smooth deflection patterns mimicking gravitational lensing

Spiraling and scattering depending on entry angle

High consistency with classical spacetime behavior

4. Physical Interpretation

This model allows interpretation as an analog gravity system:

Represents vacuum curvature via geometry alone

Could inspire optical or mechanical analogs

Requires no exotic matter or singularities

Energy Estimate:

To create this curvature at human scale (2m radius): ~3.6 * 10^43 J

At microscopic scale (1 micron): ~9.0 * 10^25 J

5. Experimental Outlook

Potential platforms:

Optics: refractive index shaping via metamaterials

Acoustic systems with curvature-dependent propagation

3D printed mechanical membranes

Goal:

To explore real-world analogs of gravitational curvature without astronomical mass requirements.

6. Open Questions

Can this geometry be embedded in 3+1 GR as a stable vacuum slice?

Does it extend to dynamic (time-dependent) cases?

Can it support analog Hawking-like emission in the lab?

7. Code and Visuals

Python source code (ready for Jupyter):

Metric tensor construction

Ricci tensor analysis

Geodesic simulation with solve_ivp

3D and 2D visualization
